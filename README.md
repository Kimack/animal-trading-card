frontend-nanodegree-Animal-Trading-Cards-Overview
===============================

# Description
This is a Udacity's front-end nanodegree project in which we started with a [Polymer-like](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) paper-card displaying an animal description (see __design-prototype.pdf__) and needed to make a replicate of it in a plain html/css format.
